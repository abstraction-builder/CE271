* GUI vs CLI?
* We just need to be productive with our virtual machines!
* Today's topics: basics commands, structure of the commands, file system navigation, command line editing and finding help


Commands to discuss:
* Navigation
	** pwd cd ls
	** Discuss absolute path vs relative path
	** Parent directory and current dir (. and ..)
	** Hidden files begins with . Use ls -a to list them. Don't mess up these files

* Exploring the system
	** ls file less more 
	** Discuss command arguments

* Example: Let's cd into some(interesting) directory, list the directory contents with -l flag. Then, if you see some interesting file determine its contents with file command and maybe try printing out it with less.

* Visit page 54 and read organization of file system!

* Manipulating files and directories:
	** Commands: cp mv mkdir rm ln
	** Discuss wild cards: Like copping every .c file to a particular directory
 	**
